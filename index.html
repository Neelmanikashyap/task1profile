                Hello! I am Neelmani Kashyap, a BCA (Bachelor of Computer Applications) student with a passion for web development. I have a strong foundation in HTML and CSS, and I'm excited to continue expanding my skills in the world of web technologies.
            </p>
            <p>
                My journey in web development began when I realized the power of creating visually appealing and user-friendly websites. I enjoy the process of turning ideas into interactive and responsive web experiences.
            </p>
            <p>
                When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring new technologies, solving coding challenges, or working on personal web projects. I believe in the importance of continuous learning and staying up-to-date with the latest trends in web development.
            </p>
            <p>
                I'm passionate about creating websites that not only look great but also provide a seamless user experience. Whether it's designing user interfaces or optimizing website performance, I'm always up for a coding challenge.
            </p>
            <p>
                Feel free to explore my portfolio to see some of my recent projects. If you'd like to get in touch or collaborate on a project, don't hesitate to contact me.
